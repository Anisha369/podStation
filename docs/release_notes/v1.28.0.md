# v1.28.0 - Release Notes

Hello podStation user!

Here is what is new.

## New features

### Support for `<itunes:duration>`

[Issue #163](https://github.com/podStation/podStation/issues/163)

With this release we implemented support for the `<itunes:duration>` tag on RSS feeds for podcasts.

If a podcast uses this tag in its episodes, the duration will now be shown on the lists of episodes and also on the playlist.
