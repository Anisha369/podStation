# v1.24.0 - Release Notes

Hello podStation user!

Here is what is new.

## New features

### Enabled search on Podcastindex.org

This is an implementation for feature [#124](https://github.com/podStation/podStation/issues/124) (github)

Have you ever heard of [Podcastindex.org](https://podcastindex.org/)?

In case you have not, it is a new open podcast index. If you would like to know more, check this article on podnews.net: [The Podfather launches a new, open podcast directory](https://podnews.net/update/podcast-index-open-directory)

With this version we have added support for searching in this index.

The results you see for the search are now a merge from all the supported indexes and directories.

One thing you will notice, many results will now contain a description, as this is available on Podcastindex.org, but not on iTunes.

I have chosen to prioritize showing the 100x100 artwork returned by iTunes, as it is much smaller (in terms of download size) than the usual artworks published by the podcast in their RSS feed.

## Technical Changes

The content of https://github.com/podStation/podStationNGReuse has been integrated back to the source code of podStation.

It has been moved into a reusable library in the past with the goal of building a AngularJS powered cordova app for mobile, that was never released (the source of this app will eventually be released).
