# v1.22.0 - Release Notes

Hello podStation user!

Here is what is new.

## New features

### Removed "tabs" Permission

This is an implementation for feature [#54](https://github.com/podStation/podStation/issues/54) (github)

Have you ever notice the following warning when installing podStation?

> (It can) Read your browsing history

Don't worry, podStation did not really read your browsing history.

The warning appears because podStation required the "tabs" permission.  
This permission was used to bring existing podStation tabs into focus in a few situations, the most commons being when you clicked the podStation button on the browser toolbar.

I found a way to get the same effect without the permission though.

This is part of the [Remove intrusive permissions](https://github.com/podStation/podStation/milestone/1) milestone, click on the link to know more.
