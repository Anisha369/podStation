# v1.26.0 - Release Notes

Hello podStation user!

Here is what is new.

## New features

### Dark mode

[Issue #135](https://github.com/podStation/podStation/issues/135)

With this release we introduced the option to use a dark mode, which seems very popular these days.

Use the adjust icon on the top right corner to switch to the new mode.

Special thanks to [Ashish Patel](https://github.com/ashishpatel1992) for implementing this feature.
