# v1.25.0 - Release Notes

Hello podStation user!

Here is what is new.

## New features

### New and changed keyboard commands

Long time ago I have implemented the _Play/Pause podcast_ command, which was globally intercepting the Play/Pause Media Key (the one you see sometimes on keyboards).

Since then, chrome improved how it handles Media, and has a better support for standard Media Keys.

According to my tests, the current integration is good enough so that the use of commands is not necessary (the command, as currently configured is completely hijacking the media key).

So, this change will disable the default key Keyboard Shortcut for the _Play/Pause podcast_. I don't expect any changes for current users, but new users should have the default behavior from chrome now.

Users can still define a shortcut at <chrome://extensions/shortcuts>, if they want to use the keys exclusively for podStation.

Additionally, I introduced new commands for media control:

- Seek forward,
- Seek backward,
- Next Episode,
- Previous Episode.

I imagine that many users would like to map the Next and Previous track Media Keys to Seek forward and backward, but I decided not to deliver this default setting, so that it respects chrome's standard behavior.
