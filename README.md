# podStation Chrome Extension

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/podStation/podStation.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/podStation/podStation)

## About 

**podStation** is a podcast aggregator for chrome.
It is distributed as a browser extension (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_extension), but it behaves essentially like a standalone app that uses Chrome as a platform. 

You can install it at the [chrome web store][at-chrome-web-store].

Although not officially supported (no tests in place), it also works on:
- Opera (https://www.opera.com/)
- Chromium (I think, https://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/download-chromium)
- Kiwi (mobile, it works, but the experience is not nice, https://kiwibrowser.com/)

### Vision

podStation has reached a mature state where increments are more tipically on the direction of bug fixes, optimizations and reduction of technical debt (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt).

If you would like to see all the proposed enhancements, check the open issues:
* at [github][open-issues-at-github],
* at [bitbucket][open-issues-at-bitbucket].

For an idea of the work in progress, check our [planning project][planning-project].

Some features I consider more important (I will add links to existing issues later):
- Become **podStation Browser Extension**: podStation is currently only available for chrome. Althouth this most likely address the majority of possible users, I don't like the idea of contributing to _vendor lock-in_. Having a port that works on other browsers would make it easier for our users to choose other browsers, and contribute to the competitiveness of this market
- Reduce the necessary _permissions_ required by podStation

There are also some features that I would like to implement, but they are unlikely to become a reality, as it would be a lot of effort:
- Support _marking episodes as listened_ (history) - not enough Snyc Storage space
- Integration with [mygpo](https://github.com/gpodder/mygpo) (http://gpodder.net/)

## Development

### Installing the dependencies

You will need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

After that, install the dependencies in the following order:
* `npm install`
* `npm run bower-install`
* `./copy_dependencies.sh`

### Running locally

1. Clone this repository
2. Go to chrome's extensions page [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/)
3. Enable the _Developer Mode_
4. Click the button _Load unpacked extension_.
5. Choose the `extension` folder

Voil√†!  
You should see podStation's icon on chrome's toolbar.  
You are now running a local copy of podStation, have fun!

### Automated tests

We use Karma for automated tests.

You can run the tests with the command line `npm test`. 
If you want to debug the tests run `npm run test_chrome` if you just want to run them.
